*how to add a file 
 echo "hello world" >>start.txt

*We can use cat command to display contents in the file

*initially when we add the file this is untracked when use the command "git status"
*when we use "git add start.txt" 
*after that we get the git status as new file in the staging area 
*in this staging area we havent commited anything yet the staging are is designed to allow you to build up several changes so they can be commited

* now lets move forward by commiting the new file into the repository using the command "git commit -m "adding start text file"

now we can check git status we can get working directory is clean 

now the new file is moved from the staging are into local repository.
 
still the file is not in github it is on local repository.

* by using the command "git push origin main" then we can get the file into our github.
